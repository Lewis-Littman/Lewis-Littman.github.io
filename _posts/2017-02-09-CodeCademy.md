  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>At the start of the lesson I was at 38% through the course with decent understanding of basic things to do with python, like strings, lists and more.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To complete another section on python so I will be around 43% so I can have a steady increase in understanding of Python.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I did reach my target during the lesson as I completed another course on codecademy.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I did the same as I did for the last few weeks by just reading through the code problems and to try stay focused as much as possible. I had to go back to the previous codes and re-read what was there to remind myself of what we did and what worked. This time I needed a little bit of help as I got stuck on one question for a long time so I asked my mate for a little hint.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>When I was working through the codes and through the course I got stuck on a question for quite a long time so I think I need to either go back to the previous questions to refresh my memory or to re-read the guidelines until I am sure that I know everything about the code that I need to know. This will help me not get stuck on questions for so long so I can get even more done.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will go back through the challenges if I get stuck on a question with no progression for more than five minutes so I will keep on advancing so I can keep learning more and more of Python during the lessons and at home.</td>
