Today in IT we learnt about propaganda. Propaganda is communication that is biased and sometimes used to promote things, such as in advertisements. We looked at different advertisements and how they used propaganda. 

**1. Glittering Generalities **Words of praise for product or person; nice words like goodness or patriotism.

**2. Name Calling **Trash-talking another product or person.

**3. Testimonial **A famous person recommends a product or a political endorsement.

**4. Plain Folks **Appeals to regular people and their values such as health, family and patriotism.

**5. Bandwagon **An appeal to be part of the group.

**6. Transfer **An appeal that helps a person imagine themselves as part of a picture.

**7. Card-stacking **Manipulating information to make a product appear better than it is, often by unfair comparison or omitting facts.

For homework we have to find 3 different newspaper headings and say what type of propaganda they are using.

I believe this article is trying to 'name call' the government as it say’s that the government has denied access to a second vote and it also say’s that the government usually debate a petition with 100,000 signatures when the second European campaign had 4.1 million. This could also be Card-stacking as there are two facts here that could be wrong.

This is a news article on the new PM Theresa May, I think this is Testimonial as David Cameron (someone famous)  is telling everyone that May will do amazing as the new PM and is ensuring everyone that she will be a good PM. This can also be Glittering generalities.

In this news article there is a advert/video which explains the new xbox they are creating called the xbox scorpio. I think this is Card-stacking as there is a lot of information in the video and numbers in it and with xbox having a 'competition' against Sony with their playstation console, so they would probably change a few statistics to look better than sony.
