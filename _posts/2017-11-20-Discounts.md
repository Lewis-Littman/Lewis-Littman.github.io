    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>The starting point for me is that I have quite a decent understanding of how to code using google sheets.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To apply what I have learnt to create a piece of coding that calculates discounts and special offers for me, without help.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Both yes and no, I managed to get my discounts working perfectly with a discount multiplier and and switch using a certain amount of items that had to be bought to toggle the discount.</td>

    <td>Today we had a cover lesson had to to try and code a system that helped us deal with discounts and any special offers my shop is having. As it was a cover lesson I had to work with other people to share our ideas of how to code the system (mainly the special offers part of the coding). In the end, however, we did get a piece of code that did, mostly, work.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I feel like the lesson went a lot slower, as we did not have a teacher to rely on if we get completely stuck. This limited my learning as I couldn't work as fast and had to really think about what code to use where, which I guess is also a good thing.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For next time I want to be able to have enough time to completely finish the task, which will require me to be more efficient so I can manage my time better. I also want to try and refine my special discount system to make it work alongside my discount system.</td>
