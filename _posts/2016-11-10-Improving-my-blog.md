Today we were working on improving our blog post. Our teacher showed us the marking scheme and I graded my self a 4/9 but my target is to get to 6/9 by the end of the day. To get this mark I need to add a background image and to try add boxes around my blog posts to make it look better. To do this I will need to think flexibly to find the information to help me make these improvements. I also think I need to start improving my blog posts by being more meaningful and explaining what I have learnt in the lesson.
