**Binary:**

Binary is a common way of counting especially in computers due to it only consisting of 1's and 0’s. Binary is in base 2. Numbers look like a series of 1’s and 0’s and you work out what they are by the right to left. The most right represents 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 (from right to left).

To convert to hexadecimal from binary you use the nibbles of 8, 4, 2, and 1 and find out what the binary would sum to using the nibbles and that would give you the numbers.

**Hexadecimal:**

Hexadecimal is in base 16. You work this out but multiplying the first number by 16 and then adding the second number. The numbers go 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 then A, B, C, D, E, F with A representing 10 and F representing 15. So A5 would be 165. 

To convert between hexadecimal and binary you need to associate the left number in hexadecimal with the left nibble in binary and the right number with the right nibble. You then use 8, 4, 2, 1 to try add to what the number is. If you have FE then on the left you would have 1111 and on the right you'd have 1110.
