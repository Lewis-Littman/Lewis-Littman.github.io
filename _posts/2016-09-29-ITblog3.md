Today Arun and I couldn't get our fuze box to work; we believe it was something to do with the cable but we aren't sure. We then had to split up and join two different groups. My group was working on creating pacman by creating a yellow circle (for the mouth closed) and then they made a black triangle in the circle to make the mouth open. Then the teacher fixed our fuze box so we started to work again. We started to create string variables that allowed us to talk to the fuze.
