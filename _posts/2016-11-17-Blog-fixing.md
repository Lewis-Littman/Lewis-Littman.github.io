Blog fixing 17-11-16

Today I am starting with quite a rubbish blog page. My target this lesson is to improve the look of my blog page. Did I achieve my target? Yes.

What did I do about my blog page?

I made my blog look better by changing the background to a nice image of space and I added borders around the text.

What I want to do next lesson? 

Next lesson I want to add a background that has an opacity of 0.5 to the boxes that surround my text so the text is easier to read.

What did I learn?

I learnt how to add borders and background images to my blog page. I know I learnt this as I was able to explain how to do this to other people.

Conclusion: I think this lesson was very successful as I learnt more about coding and I also achieved my target!
