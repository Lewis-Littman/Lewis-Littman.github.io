  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>My starting point for the lesson was that I did not have any of my coding done for my quiz and that I have to catch up quite a bit as I was not in school last week.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To finish my quiz coding and have it working well.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I did reach my target as I did manage to finish the buzzfeed quiz as you will see later as I have embedded it.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Well they way my code works is quite simple. The question is printed along with answers. After this the answer they choose is recorded using input. The answer they choose is related to an animal which will cause the total score to go up by an amount or go down by an amount. The end score will determine what animal you are by using greater than and  smaller than. EG: If the total score is bigger than 45 and smaller than 60 you are a dog. Once your animal has been recorded it will then print what you are. If you input an invalid answer for any question you will have to restart the quiz as it automatically stops the script from running.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to make the code more practical as for them to answer the question they had to answer with the exact answer not an A, B, C, D and E. This is also the case for other parts of the quiz.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make my code more practical by adding letter answers and also by adding in a system that if an invalid answer was given then it would just repeat the question instead of making them restart the whole quiz. This would prevent people from having to restart the quiz if they make a simple spelling error or capital error.
