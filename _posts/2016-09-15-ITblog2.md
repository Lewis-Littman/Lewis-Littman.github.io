Today we did more work on our fuze book and everyone is working at their own pace, which is great as we don't have to rush or be dragged down. We coded a mini countdown for apples so we get the machine to say "we have 6 apples" and then we got it to say “if we eat one we have one less”. Using a variable we managed to minus apples as we ate them. The way you make a variable is by typing (variable name)==(value). Today was great fun and I can't wait for next week!
