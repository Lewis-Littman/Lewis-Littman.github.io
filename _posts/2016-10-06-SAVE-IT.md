Today we made a small game called "guess the number". The game is really simple and easy to make. The game is that the computer generates a never between 1 and 100. Then we are asked to chose a number. If the number is bigger than the number the number the computer generated it will say “too high” and if your number is smaller than the number the computer generated the computer will say “too small”. However after we had finished we took the USB out without saving it. So the lesson I learnt today is save my work frequently.
