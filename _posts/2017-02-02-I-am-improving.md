  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To increase my percentage by 5% and to be able explain more about python and different aspects of it. For homework I want to also increase my percent by 5% or do at least an hour of work on codecademy.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes I managed to get to 33% during the lesson and now I need to increase that to 38% or to do an hour of codecademy for homework.</td>

    <td>This lesson I did the same as last lesson, which was to try stay focused as much as possible. It is also very useful to go back to the previous codes and re-read what was there to remind yourself and what you did and what worked.
I also think that you should try help other people by giving them small hints as this well tell you if you really do know the Python coding as you can explain it to someone else.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I got stuck on one code problem for quite a long time and needed a bit of help and got hint from someone else I think I would progress further if I asked for help earlier as I would have got to have done more but I was too afraid as I wanted to be independent.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will ask my friends around me for help if I get stuck for over 10 minutes and not be afraid to admit that I am stuck and ask for help so I can progress and hopefully understand more.
There is no point to me doing codecademy if I can't progress but I also need to understand what I am doing so I can apply it in the future.</td>
