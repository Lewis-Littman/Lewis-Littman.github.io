Today we did a little bit of fuze box work and we also worked a little on our blog posts. We made our blog post title's a lot more interesting instead of just IT blog1, IT blog2, IT blog3 e.g. To something more creative such as: working. On the fuze box we learnt how to colour different pixels on the screen using binary. We made one of the space invaders. We also got 2 different pictures to flash between each other. Hopefully next lesson we will go straight onto the fuze box as I am really enjoying it.
