    <td>At the start of this lesson I was at 52% in the Python course on codecademy.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>My target for this lesson is either to increase my course by 5% or finish the next section. My target for homework is to increase by around 5% or to finish the next section.</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The only thing that I did did differently today was that I sat next to someone who was on the same percent as me so that we could help each other and work together through the course. I feel like this helped me a lot as when ever I got stuck I could ask my friend and he would be able to give me a help as he had already done the coding. It was the same for him.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Not much limited my learning but if I had to chose something it would be talking about things that weren't relevant to my friend.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I think I will keep sitting next to my friend so we can still help each other but I need to learn to not talk about things that aren’t relevant so I don’t get distracted. If I do get distracted I won’t be able to finish as much as the course as I would otherwise.</td>
