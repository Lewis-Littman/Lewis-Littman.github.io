  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Todays starting point is at 52% and as last week I was off ill I only improved by 5% instead of the usual 10%, which is why I need to try my best to catch up.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>My target for this lesson is to complete the next section in the course and increase my percentage by 5 so it will be around 57%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I did reach my target to finish the next section but my percent did not change so I did not reach my full target.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Like last lesson I just kept re-reading the instructions when I got stuck and sometimes I had to go back to the start of the section of the course, which is where it explained the basics of the new thing that we were learning to do. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to learn not to give up as there was one code problem I couldn't finish and I almost gave up, which wouldâ€™ve prevented me from completing any of my target. This is why I need to stay determined to be one of the first to finish and to complete the course but also whilst understanding as much as possible about Python.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will not even think about giving up and my friend my change places as he is around the same place as me so we can help each other out when we get stuck and give each other hints.</td>
  </tr>
