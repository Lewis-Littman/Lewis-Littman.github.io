  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>My starting point is that I have got a good understanding of how to code using python. However, I have forgotten most of it because of the holiday.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>My target for this lesson is to refresh my memory about what we did before the holidays.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I did achieve my target as I managed to get through most of the work quite easily as I managed to remember what we did before.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>This lesson we went back on what we left off on, which was functions. I managed to remember quite quickly how to define and make functions, which helped me a lot throughout the lesson. I also learned that you can put functions inside of functions which made it really easy to create a random card picker. The card picker would randomly choose numbers which would tell you what suit the card was in and what number/picture it was.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I struggled with fixing errors in my code. For example I would make really silly mistakes like indent errors which I wouldn't notice very quickly. This caused me not to work as quick as a could’ve, which isn’t ideal. This was my main problem this lesson so this is going to be the main thing I’m going to need to work on.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For next time I am going to go back over my coding every few lines and just read it back to me. By doing this I will hopefully spot mistakes a lot quicker and before I start doing something that won’t work because of that mistake. This will make my work a lot more efficient as I won’t have to go back on myself as much.</td>
