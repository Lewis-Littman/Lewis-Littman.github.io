    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>A basic understanding of python, knowing about various things such as variables and strings.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To get through more of the course on python so I can learn more about it and to be able to code small codes to do various things.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes I can now code small things using python and have gotten further into the course.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I worked my way through the course reading everything thoroughly to make sure that I knew everything and could get through the levels and advance further. I found this effective as it expanded my learning of python really well and it is an easy course to follow. I think that codecademy is an extremely useful site to learn coding on as it provides you with all the information on how to do certain things with the coding language.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I got stuck towards the end of the lesson and I forgot how to do a certain part of the code so I should've gone back through the course to find the explanation again to be able to refresh my memory on how it works.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will look back through the course whenever I get stuck so I can get through with understanding not just by guessing so I actually know what I did and why it worked. This will improve my learning as it will solidate my learning of certain parts of the coding language, Python.</td>
