I believed that the identity map changed the way I think about the way I use social media, because now I know what to expect on them, trolls, people being mean and just general people. I really liked the way we commented on these as you didn't have to stand up in front of the class, which would be quite nerve racking, and all you had to do was to write a few note down on a piece of paper. However it was a lot harder commenting to people we knew as you know they are humans and emotions, so I tried not to be too mean. I prefered this method of presentation then standing up to give a speech or something like that. The identity map didnâ€™t change the way I think about what media I will use in the future as I already I had an idea of what I would use, such as, twitter on news or facebook to talk to friends. The identity map taught me that even if I think I know the instruction to the task I should still check google classroom just incase, I learned this because I thought I knew what I was doing but actually there were additional instructions!
