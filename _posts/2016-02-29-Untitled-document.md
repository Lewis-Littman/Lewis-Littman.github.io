Today we looked at some simple coding, we did this by playing some cool little games that you had to move a character and do simple commands, such as; make the move up, down, left, right; attack people; jump and collect things. we did this by using simple commands like self.move(direction to move) or self.attack("enemy") this allowed us to create scripts for our character to do. If we finished the first activity we then had to make a little robot go around to light up blocks and to do this you had to create scripts using a certain amount of script blocks. It was really fun as you had to try find your mistakes within the script!
