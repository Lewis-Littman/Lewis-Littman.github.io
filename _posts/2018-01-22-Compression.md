    <td>Today I learned about the advantages and disadvantages of compression and how it works. It works by recognising patterns in the file and storing that pattern as one bit of data. The advantage of compressing files are that it makes the files a lot smaller in file size (mb, gb). However, if there are no patterns in the file, the file size could increase, which is one of the disadvantages of compression. Lossy compression is where quality is lost when compressing, but the file will be a lot smaller. Lossless is where no quality is lost but the file will not be as small as they remain the same quality.</td>

I have a decent understanding of what compression is and what to use it for

My target for this lesson is to learn more about compression and the different types of compression.

I did reach my target as now I know about lossy and lossless types of compression and what compression is used for.

Today I learned about the advantages and disadvantages of compression and how it works. It works by recognising patterns in the file and storing that pattern as one bit of data. The advantage of compressing files are that it makes the files a lot smaller in file size (mb, gb). However, if there are no patterns in the file, the file size could increase.
