  <tr>
    <td>This lesson was very simple as it was mainly a case of just listening and learning. We watched and looked at what Mr. Tansley's work looked like and then we learnt a few more basic commands like =Sheet1!(b2), which allows you to interact between all of the different sheets you have on one document. To prove I have learnt something I am going to try embed my google sheets on this post.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I feel like I did quite well this lesson and I really don’t think that anything limited my learning except from maybe my speed. I think that, possibly, I could’ve worked faster and tried getting more work done so I had less work to do at home.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>Next time I will try work faster so I don’t have to do as much work at home or even try possibly get onto some extension work and try get ahead.</td>
