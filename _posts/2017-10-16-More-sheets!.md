    <td>Starting point:</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>My target for this lesson is to be able to add embedded links to my blog posts and to also finalize my google sheets by making it all a lot neater. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>This lesson was very simple as it was mainly a case of just listening and learning. We watched and looked at what Mr. Tansley's work looked like and then we learnt a few more basic commands like =Sheet1!(b2), which allows you to interact between all of the different sheets you have on one document. To prove I have learnt something I am going to try embed my google sheets on this post.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I feel like I did quite well this lesson and I really don’t think that anything limited my learning except from maybe my speed. I think that, possibly, I could’ve worked faster and tried getting more work done so I had less work to do at home.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try work faster so I don’t have to do as much work at home or even try possibly get onto some extension work and try get ahead.</td>
