Today we didn't really do much we just looked at how we could make a good identity map, on the map we had to include our hobbies what social media we have used, what we still use and what we might use in the future. I put that in the future i will use facebook and twitter to see the latest news and see what my friends are doing and also i might also use some other social media site that are more formal for work!
