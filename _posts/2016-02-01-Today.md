Today we looked at a video that was about someone who didn't have a phone on them and all her friends did. All her friends incidentally were excluding her because they were all on their phones! It shows how people are addicted to social media and recording great moments instead of just embracing the moment. we also watched a video about twitter and it was a song about twitter where someone didn’t like twitter but everyone else was using it so she sort of got involved!
