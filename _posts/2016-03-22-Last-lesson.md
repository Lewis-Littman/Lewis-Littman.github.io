Today we mainly just looked at what are Easter homework project was and how to do complete it effectively. The project is to create a prezi (presentation) on the history of computers. We looked at bad examples of the project and what not to do, which will make it a bit easy for us to better! We didn't do too much that lesson as it was the last lesson of the term.
