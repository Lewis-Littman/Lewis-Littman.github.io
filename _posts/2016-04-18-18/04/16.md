18/04/16 Today we just went over 2 examples of prezis that the class had made (one of which was mine) and we went over what they did well and needed to improve on. I'm glad that Mr. Keen went over my Prezi as now I know exactly what i need to improve on for my homework, which is to improve our prezis. We also have to asses someone else’s blogs on google classroom!
