    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>A fun lesson where we play lots of games.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To have fun.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes as I had lots of fun and learnt how to code on both lightbot and spritebox.</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learned how to visually image what would happen to the bots depending on what I selected. It was easier if I used my finger to keep my place to see where my bot would be depending on my code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I don't think anything limited my learning as today was a fun lesson and managed to complete every lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson if we ever do this again I think I will try complete all the stages once more but trying to do it with as little coding as possible as I challenge so I will have to visualise the code even more and it will be a lot harder.</td>
