    <td>I carried on using dictionaries and lists in the coding to find and store information. Today I had to do a mini project, a series of coding tasks, that allowed me to record the class average (of an imaginary class). The way the code worked was that I stored each of the students scores in a dictionary, then I had to find the average by dividing the all the students scores and dividing by the amount of scores they had. Then I added grade boundaries to give them grades. After that I defined the class average and finally printed the class average score and grade.</td>
