Today we talked more on sexting and revenge porn! We learnt how sexting can ruin people's lives. Sexting can ruin people's lives by sending someone sending a picture of themselves (possibly nude) to someone else and the person receiving the picture could spread across internet. If you are sexting underage you could get a criminal record and it will be harder to get jobs and not many people will respect you as you sexted.

We also got our microbits today and can implement our code into it!
