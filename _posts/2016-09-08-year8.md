I just had my first lesson of IT in year 8. We are starting to code on fuze's which are like raspberry piâ€™s.

In year 7 we learnt: how to code using microbit; safety online (sexting and revenge porn); propaganda; social media and computer components. I enjoyed learning how to code using javascript the most because we went on to make a game which we could play! Overall I feel my strengths were listening in class and my weakness was getting work done during class. This is why my target for this year is to get more work done inside of the class, which could also help my finish homework.

Year 7 was a fantastic year!
