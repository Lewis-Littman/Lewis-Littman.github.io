  <tr>
    <td>Today we were going to coding but when we went to the front to ask questions someone asked how to add youtube videos to our blog posts which I will be trying to do this post. After learning how to add the video we watched the video, which was on sexism and using phrases like 'you throw like a girl' as an insult.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I don't think anything limited my learning as I believe that I listened well to what Mr Keen was saying and I will prove this by adding a video to this blog.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try ask questions more and get more involved with the lesson as I just listened to what everyone else was saying and I didn’t contribute too much.</td>
