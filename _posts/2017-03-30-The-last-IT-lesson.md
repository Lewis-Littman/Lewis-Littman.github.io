    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Quite a good knowledge of python and all the different ways to use it and how to create relatively simple codes but also some difficult ones too.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To complete all the tasks that Mr Keen sets us during the lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes as I finished all the task that Mr Keen set us and I also complete the homework which was to create this code that helps with maths.</td>

    <td>What did we do today?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Today we did not learn much as we were just applying our knowledge to create a code. I guess this is teaching us if we actually know the coding language. The end result is the piece of code that we created on repl.it and is posted for my teacher to review on classroom. This code has a bunch of functions that all do different maths calculations. This code asks for what function you want to use and then asks for the measurements needed to complete that function. It will then complete the maths and print the result.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Due to the way our lessons work during year 8 we will be moving on to drama after the Easter holiday meaning I probably won't be posting for a while. I will most likely be back posting at the start of the next academic year.</td>
