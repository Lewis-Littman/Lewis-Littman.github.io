    <td>I had to research what to do independently. I used a very useful site called W3schools which gives information on how to code. I have only recently started to use this site and it is extremely useful. I recommend this site to everyone that has blog.

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I was a bit slow on finding the information so I think I need to get quicker at doing this. On the website there are small tabs on the side of the web page that categorise what you are looking for, as I was trying to get tables to work on my blog I should've gone straight to the tables tab.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson I am going to work on adding a container to my blog that is slightly translucent so the text is easier to read. I might also remove the tables and add back the borders. To improve my learning I will try work quicker so I can learn more.</td>
