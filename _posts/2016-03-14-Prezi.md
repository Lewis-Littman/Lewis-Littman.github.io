Today in IT we looked at presentation and what it was. Presentation is a speech or talk where a new product, idea, or piece of work is shown and explained to an audience. Then we looked at this website called Prezi that allows us to easily create presentations, you can create little sections to write in and add images and all sorts. It makes it so at the start you see the whole presentation then it zooms in/out on certain information in the order we set it!
