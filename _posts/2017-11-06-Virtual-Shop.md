    <td>This lesson we were creating a virtual shop. We did this by creating a stock list of all the items we wanted to sell and then also creating a price list. Once doing this we then created a list of all the items the customer were buying. Then using the vlookup command we found these prices and then added them all together with how many of those items he bought.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We were quite limited on time as we had to go over everything we did before the half term as well meaning that I needed to work quickly. I didn't quite finish all of the work and missed out on trying to experiment with incorporating discounts to it. So I have to work on working with speed.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try be as quick as possible when doing my work, which hopefully allow me to move onto extension work even during the lesson.</td>
