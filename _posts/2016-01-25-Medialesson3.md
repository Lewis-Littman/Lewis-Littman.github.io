Today in IT we talked about what rules we should use to make sure we don't make wrong choices using media, like don't post anything that you wouldn't say/do to someoneâ€™s face, or don't post anything you don't want your parents to see. We also talked about disadvantages and advantages of social media, for example: some advantages would be you can get news quickly and you can talk to your friends and make friends. A disadvantage would be that there are people who make something completely innocent to something horrible.
