Today in IT we didâ€¦

today we learnt about media literacy, and we did a bingo sheet where we asked each other different questions about media. The goal was to get a row of yes'. we learnt about different medias such as the newspaper, instagram, snapchat, facebook, twitter, radio, whatsapp and many other medias! we talked about snapchat a lot as it is used to post personal things that people can only see for a few seconds and also if they screenshot it will tell you that they have.
