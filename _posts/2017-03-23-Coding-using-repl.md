    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>My target is to try explore my knowledge of python codes and to complete the task mr Keen set us.</td>

    <td>Today we used a new website called repl.it and we watched mr Keen code on it and he asked us to explain what the code would do and how to change it. I think this was to test our knowledge just to make sure everyone is learning something. He then asked us to make a bit of code that asks for the sides of the rectangle and then it needs to work out the perimeter and area of that rectangle.</td>

    <td>I need to work on getting more involved again as I feel I could have contributed more even though I did answer a few questions.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try answer as many questions as I can even if i'm not 100% sure because it will let me know if I actually understand when I find out the correct answer.</td>
