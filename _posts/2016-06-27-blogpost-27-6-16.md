Today we learnt what social media has done for both the good and the bad. As a class we decided the spreading news and talking to friends over social media was good, however, we decided sexting and pornography were bad. For our homework we had to find two news reports. One on revenge porn (which is when someone releases photos of their partner naked after the have split up) and one on sexting (which is when you and your partner send naked pictures to each other).

The revenge porn link:
