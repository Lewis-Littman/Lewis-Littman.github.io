    <td>A good looking blog with lots of different features.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Today I didn't really have a goal except from to experiment around with the blog and to see what works and what doesn’t.</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>I talked to Mr Tansley on what he thought would look nice and also looked up some colour schemes on the internet to help with the design of my blog. The colour scheme of my blog right now is relatively blue. I also started to think about my background and if it was an effective background and was relative to the subject.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I feel like I got distracted too easily as I wasn't as focused on a set goal. I also spent quite a while looking things up on the internet. I think this was because I wasn’t that detailed in my search so the results were varied.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Because I got a bit distracted talking to my friends and spending too long searching for answers on the internet I am going to set a realistic goal next lesson and try to find the answers straight away by being more detailed in my search.</td>
