Today was quite chaotic for me, it started fine, it was simple and quite easy. Then i tried to post my first post but instead of deleting the original post i deleted the whole folder so i had to restart, luckily i could remember how to do everything and managed to do it all. I didn't know what to do at first so i started to panic, but then i just said to myself i?ll just have to restart, and i did!
