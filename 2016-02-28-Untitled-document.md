Creating my identity map was quite fun but I thought I knew what I was doing when i missed I few instructions that went up onto google classroom! I didn't feel that bad about sharing my identity because I didn't feel I had anything embarrassing on it. When i was commenting on other people's identity maps I tried not to be to mean and try to comment mainly on the good things! I prefered this to standing up in front of everyone and giving a presentation as I felt a lot less nervous. When I was reading through the comment on my mpa I wasn’t that surprised as there was a good mix of praise and constructive criticism. It’s a lot different to commenting online as you know the person quite well and know there a person and that they have emotions rather than if you don’t know them, you might not really care what you say. To me the map made me think more about what I want to post online as I realise how easy it is for people to say rude things to me. It didn’t make me change the media I use today but I have an idea of the sorts of media I’ll use in the future. These lessons helped me understand how some people use media to mess with you or to be rude to you and that some people just want to talk to people. You also have to be careful on social media because you never know who you’re actually talking to. This didn’t really change what social media I might use in the future because I already had an idea of what I would use, like twitter for news, and facebook to talk with friends!
